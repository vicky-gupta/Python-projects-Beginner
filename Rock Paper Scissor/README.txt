| Rock-Paper-Scissor Game in Python using Random |

Rock-Paper-Scissor Game is a project for beginner.

Random Module Python:
Sometimes we want the computer to pick a random number in a given range, pick a random element from a list,
pick a random card from a deck, flip a coin, etc. The random module provides access to functions that support
these types of operations. The random module is another library of functions that can extend the basic
features of python. Other modules we have seen so far are string, math, time and graphics.

Requirements: 
-python random library
-python 3
