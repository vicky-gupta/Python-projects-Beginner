| DICE Simulator Game in Python using Random |

Dice simulator is a project for beginner.
The Dice Roll Simulation can be done by choosing a random integer between 1 and 6 for which we can use 
the random module in the Python programming language.

Random Module Python:
Sometimes we want the computer to pick a random number in a given range, pick a random element from a list,
pick a random card from a deck, flip a coin, etc. The random module provides access to functions that support
these types of operations. The random module is another library of functions that can extend the basic
features of python. Other modules we have seen so far are string, math, time and graphics.

Requirements: 
-python random library
-python 3

How to run:
-Just run the code in any command line
